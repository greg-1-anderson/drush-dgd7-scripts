drush-dgd7-scripts
==================

Before you can do anything with these scripts, you must open
the file 00-00-init and customize it for your system.  See
comments in the script.

The numbered scripts, nn-nn-script-name, are the different
scripts used as examples in the Drush chapter of the book
Definitive Guide to Drupal 7.  You can run these, but you
have to run them in sequence, because some scripts depend on
changes made to the site by the previous script.  While this
is not very good practice for unit tests, this is the way
the examples in the chapter work, ergo these scripts behave
the same way.

If you want to run all of the scripts in sequence, you can
simply run the 'run-all' script.
